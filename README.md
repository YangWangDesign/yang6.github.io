I am a third year Planning, Governance & Globalization (PGG) Program Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech. I come from Beijing, China. I graduated in the Master of Landscape Architecture program at Auburn University on 2014. My research of interests include urban regeneration, urban regional environmental planning, land use science, data mining & analytics, urban vacant land, climate change adaptation, and Post – Occupancy Evaluation of the effects of use at the sustainable landscape and planning, particularly in the more productive use of open space and vacant land through increase application of ecological science and urban ecology. In addition, I am also interested in how our urban designs impact the sustainability of natural and social environments, then examine by Landscape Post – Occupancy Evaluation. My career goal is to become a professor at the university in Beijing, China.

### Project
#### Personalized news sentence generation
Nowadays, Deep Learning-based text generation model need huge amount of text data to learn how to write a sentence. However, people usually don't write many articles during their life, which makes it difficult to design a deep learning model to mimic personalized writing style. Thus, we introduce this novel approach to address this problem. 

This GAN-based text generation model, named as PersonGAN, possesses ability to extract personalized information from given articles belonging to one specific author. Also, PersonGAN learns basic semantic and syntax information from all given articles instead of articles of one author.

#### Course-based Projects
(All codes are available in my [Github](https://github.com/chenhan97/))
+ A simple assembler which is built with C codes. 

Method is mentioned in *System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming (3rd Edition) Chapter 2*

+ A simple [Chinese tagging system].

The system can label the POS of the sentence that you entered, which has a GUI making the training process become easy. That system is based on the HMM model and is decoded using the Viterbi algorithm.

#### Bachelor thesis

Thesis Title:

Ballistic solution and damage performance calculation software based on VC++.

In engineering research, how to develop a precise and fast solution software for projectile ballistic equation and the probability of hitting and damaging is a very hot issue. 

This thesis attempts to develop a robust and friendly interface function for industrial ballistic equations and damaging probability simulation software, which could ensure stable operation on any platform. In addition, this paper expands the novel epistemic uncertainty calculation method to solve the problem of two-dimensional plane, and then obtains the solution method of the upper and lower bounds of the projectile hit probability. Experiments on time-consuming and accuracy tasks show that the interface provided by the program related to this thesis can perform and solve related task efficiently and quickly while maintaining high accuracy.
